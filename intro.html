			<h1>A play of circles</h1>
			<p>This is a simplistic particle demo.</p>
			<p>It'll first go through a standard 8-part animation demonstration that lasts <em class="number">2</em> minutes. Then it'll enter an infinite loop of a random selection between 6 of these animations, each round lasting from <em class="number">20</em> to <em class="number">60</em> minutes.</p>
			<p>Particles are actually <code>divs</code> on DOM. <code>divs</code> are distorted with bluring and opacity. There is no WebGL involved.</p>
